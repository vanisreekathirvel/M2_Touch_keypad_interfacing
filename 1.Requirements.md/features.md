## RESEAECH 

we are going to interface a 4x2 (8 key) touch keypad with ATMEGA328 microcontroller. We all know keypad is one of the most important input devices used in electronics engineering. This module does not have actual keys, but have specially designed capacitive metal pads, and these pads are very sensitive by this method, this will provide easy solution.

## DEFINING SYSTEM

when a person gets in contact with one of the pads, there will a capacitive change in the corresponding loop, and this change will be sensed by the control electronic in the module. As a response to the touch the corresponding pad output pin goes high.  

## 4W'S and 1H

WHO

This application is used by all the persons who are all used mobile phones,calculator like electronic cadgets.

WHAT

This helps to maintain the database, send characters and data accordingly.

WHEN  

This is very useful and also it is very tedious to enter the records so here this come to handy.

WHERE 

This is very useful for all over the place especially used in all embedded electronic cadgets.

HOW

This project is implemented to who are all used touch keypad interfacing.

## SWOT Analysis

 *'s' - will opearate the cadgets very easilly
 
 *'w' - initially we are in trouble
 
 *'o' - will easily uses the cadgets by touching
 
 *'T' - a lot more pins and more inputs 
 
## REQUIREMENTS

high level requirements

numbers

character
 
string
 
low level requirements

input supply
 
delay
